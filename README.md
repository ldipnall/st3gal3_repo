# ST3GAL3 Gene Expression and Neural White matter Myelination in Children with ADHD
This project is a part of the Children's Attention Project (CAP) and Neuroimaging in Children's Attention Project (NICAP).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to investiagte the relationship between DNA methylation of the _ST3GAL3_ gene and T1w/T2w Ratio of white matter tracts in children with ADHD. Embeded within this overarching research question we will be assessing the relationships between _ST3GAL3_ DNA methyaltion and ADHD and T1w/T2w Ratio of white matter tracts and ADHD individually. ADHD will be measured dichotomously as diagnostic status, and dimensionally as symptom severity recorded by the Conner's Index.
